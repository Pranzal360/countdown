# Countdown CLI

Simple, minimal Bash countdown script that accepts **minutes** as an argument, converts them to seconds, and counts down in `MM:SS` format.

## Features
- Takes minutes as input (integer or decimal).
- Shows remaining time as `MM:SS` updating every second.
- Prints `Time's up!` when finished.
- Small and dependency-free â€” pure Bash.

## Usage
```bash
./countdown.sh <minutes>
